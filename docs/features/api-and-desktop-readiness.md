# Feature Plan: API & Desktop Readiness

## Objective
Establish stable service APIs that support both the web app and future desktop clients.

## Scope
- API facade over privileged operations
- Contract-first endpoint definitions
- Authentication and token strategy for multi-client access
- Versioning and backward compatibility

## Planned detail expansion
- Endpoint catalog and request/response schemas
- Idempotency keys and concurrency controls
- Pagination, filtering, and sort conventions
- Desktop sync and offline-ready API considerations
