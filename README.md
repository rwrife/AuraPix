# AuraPix

A modern photo management and sharing platform built with React, TypeScript, and Firebase.

## Features

- 📸 Photo library management and organization
- 📁 Albums and folder organization
- 🔐 User authentication and authorization
- 🎨 Non-destructive image editing with plugin system
- 🤝 Photo sharing and access control
- 👥 Team collaboration with role-based permissions
- ☁️ Cloud storage with Firebase
- 📱 Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Firebase project (for production deployment)

### Installation

```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
npm --prefix functions install
```

### Development

Run both frontend and backend concurrently in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Frontend (Vite): http://localhost:5173
- Backend (Express): http://localhost:3001

The frontend will automatically connect to the local backend and display a warning banner if the backend is unavailable.

### Environment Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Update the backend URL if needed:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001  # For local development
   ```

3. For Firebase deployment, update to your Cloud Functions URL:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-project.cloudfunctions.net/api
   ```

### Running Services Separately

```bash
# Frontend only
npm run dev:frontend

# Backend only
npm run dev:backend
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build both frontend and backend
npm run build

# Build separately
npm run build:frontend
npm run build:backend
```

```

## Health Monitoring

The application includes automatic backend health monitoring:

- Frontend checks backend availability every 30 seconds
- A warning banner appears at the top if the backend is unreachable
- Health status is displayed with error details
- No user action required - monitoring is automatic

## Testing

```bash
# Run frontend tests
npm test

# Run backend tests
npm --prefix functions test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Validate API contract + breaking-change gate
npm run contract:check
```

## Architecture

AuraPix follows a clean architecture approach with:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Data Layer**: Firestore (metadata) + Cloud Storage (media)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Deployment**: Firebase App Hosting + Cloud Functions

See [docs/](./docs/) for detailed architecture documentation, including [layer boundaries and import guardrails](./docs/ARCHITECTURE_BOUNDARIES.md).
